Hi! This is a project that I completed for my Scripting & Programming - Applications class. It's a console application developed with C++. The project includes 6 total source code files. The task for this project was to create a console app that manipulates a given set of student data, 
following specific guidelines, requirements, and expectations. This was my first formal experience to object-oriented programming and honestly, it was quite a challenging project. However, with perseverance and determination, I was able to get a successful output screenshot of all 
files working correctly. This project demonstrates intimate knowledge of object-oriented programming, methods, functions, header/source files, pointers, enumeration, parsing, constructors, destructors, debugging, and most importantly, perseverance!
