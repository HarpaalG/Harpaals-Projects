Hi! This is a project that I completed for my Advanced Data Management class. It's essentially a business report involving a video presentation of my SQL code as well as a written report.
My SQL code includes intermediate to advanced level queries, diplaying thorough knowledge of performing joins, creating tables, creating trigger functions, and stored procedures. 
The software I utilized was pgAdmin 4 and the query language I used was PostgreSQL.
